## Common Controls
* **Encryption** - Encoding data into ciphertext which can't be read until decrypted
* **Authentication** - Verifying a user. Anything from username & password, MFA, biometrics
* **Authorization** - Granting access to specific resources within a system

### Control types
* **Administrative** - Human component, management and policies
* **Technical** - Hardware and software
* **Physical** - Locks, cameras

## NIST CSF
Provides guidance for security professionals in handling incidents. SP 800-53 is a framework specifically for US gov.

* **Govern** - 
* **Identify** - Monitor systems to identify potential issues
* **Protect** - Implement controls and training to minimize risk
* **Detect** - Identify threats and alert team
* **Respond** - Use proper process to contain threats and document response
* **Recover** - Restore affected systems

## OWASP Principles
Open Web App Security Project

* Minimize attack surface area: Less vulnerabilities
* Least privilege: Limit user access to what's required
* Defense in depth: Have multiple levels of security controls
* Separation of duties: No one should have too much access/responsibility
* Keep security simple: Don't overcomplicate, too hard to manage
* Fix security issues correctly: Identify root cause and fix vulnerability

## Security Audit
* Review of an orgzanitions security procedures
* Internal and external
* Elements
    * Establish goals/scope
    * Risk assessment
    * Controls assessment
    * Compliance assessment
    * Communicate results

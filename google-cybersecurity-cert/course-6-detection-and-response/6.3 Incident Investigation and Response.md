## Incident Detection and Verification
* Challenges
    * Impossible to detect everything
    * High alert volumes
        * Could be misconfigured settings or genuine threat
* **Threat hunting** - proactive search for threats across network (to fill gaps in SIEM/IDS)
* **Threat intelligence** - Gathering info from public and private sources
* **Cyber deception** - Intentionally decieve threat actors
    * Honeypots are decoy systems that lure attacks
* For CI/CD Pipelines
    * Common IoC's are unauthorized/suspicious code deployment, unusual execution, compromised dependencies
    * Need proactive monitoring and comprehensive logging (commit, access, deployment, execution logs)
    * Integrate SIEM to analyze logs
* **IoCs** help identify who and what of an attack, **IoAs** focus on why and how of the attack and attacker
* Blocking some IoCs deter attackers more than others (Pyramid of Pain)
* **Crowdsourcing** - Gathering info on attacks/threats using public collaboration 
    * Plenty of platforms for sharing and gathering data from other cybersecurity professionals
    * OSINT is the collection and analysis of this data
* **Virus Total** - Service for analyzing suspicious files, urls, ip addresses
    * Lists different vendors and checks their assessments for the IoC
    * Provides details on IoC and info about how it is related to others
    * Takes community insight, but info is public so be careful
## Documentation
* Transparency
    * Demonstrating compliance (chain of custody)
* Standardization
    * Helps knowledge transfer and setting policies (like incident response plan)
* Clarity
    * Should be clear and understandable to audience
* Know your audience, be clear and concise, update regularly
* **Chain of Custody**
    * Documents evidence possession and control
    * Form is filled out as soon as evidence is collected
    * Each time evidence is transfered it is logged
* **Playbooks** - outline tasks and roles for people throughout entire incident response lifecycle
    * Non-automated: requires step by step actions
    * Automated: automates tasks like categorizing incident
    * Semi-automated: some tasks are automated some require action
## Response and Recovery
* **Triage**
    * Prioritizes incidents to make sure resources are being used efficiently
    * Process:
        * Recieve alert and determine if false positive or related to ongoing incident
        * If not, assign priority based on organization's guidelines
        * Investigate alert
    * Priority considerations:
        * **Functional impact** - Does it impact our services
        * **Information impact** - Will it leak/compromise critical info
        * **Recoverability** - How easy to recover
* **Containment**
    * Limit and prevent additional damage
    * Single device issues typically remove it from network
* **Eradication**
    * Remove all traces of the threat from systems
* **Recovery**
    * Return systems to normal, reconnect
    * Adjust network, firewall
    * **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** - Outlines procedures to keep business operations running during and after disruption
    * **Recovery sites**
        * Makes systems resilient to threats
        * **Hot sites** - Full duplicate of operational environment that can be activated immediately
        * **Warm sites** - Fully updated and configured like hot site but not ready for operation (can be quickly)
        * **Cold sites** - Backup environment with some features but needs work to be operational
## Post Incident
* Minimize chance of it happening again
* Review incident, actions taken, and effectiveness during lessons learned meeting
* Final report is created after incident and reviewed during the meeting
* Explore what could've been done differently
* **Final Report**
    * Executive summary
    * Timeline
    * Investigation (what actions taken)
    * Reccomendations

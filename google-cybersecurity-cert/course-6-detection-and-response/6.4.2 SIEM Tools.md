## SIEM
(See previous notes)
* Collects and analyzes log data
* Monitors and sends alerts
* Process:
    * Collect and process a lot of log data
    * Normalize and format raw data
        * Index data to make easy to search
    * Analyze data
* **Splunk**
    * Data analysis platform
    * Splunk Enterprise Security is a SIEM
* **Google SecOps (aka Chronicle)**
    * Google Cloud's SIEM
* Log forwarders - Software that automatically sends log data to SIEM
    * Many SIEMs have proprietary log forwarders bu can integrate with open-source ones
    * Some OS have native log forwarders or you can download third-party one
* Query SIEM data using various parameters
### Splunk
* Uses its own query language: Search Processing Language (SPL)
* Create queries using boolean operators, wildcards
* Specify index - like dataset you are searching
    * index=""
* Query for keywords or field-value pairs
* Filtering commands like where
* Use piping like Linux | 
    * ex: index=main error | chart count by host
    * Searches main index for keyword error then creates chart of the count/number of event split up by host
    * Can identify hosts with unusually high failure amounts
### Google SecOps
* Uses YARA-L to define search rules
* Default method of search is unified data model (UDM)
    * Searches normalized log data
    * Can also choose to search raw logs
    * Need to search based on normalized fields
* Has timeline like Splunk and quick filters to speed up search process

## Incident Response Lifecycle
* Relates to last three stepss of NIST CSF: Detect, Respond Recover
* NIST Incident Response Lifecycle has additional substeps
    * **Preparation**
    * **Detection and Analysis**
    * **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**
    * **Post-incident Activity**
## Incident Response Operations
* **Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT)** - Incident manangement and response teams
    * Must coordinate with other departments like legal and pr
    * Security Analyst investigates alerts and determines if there is a threat
    * For critical or complicated incidents it escalate to Technical Lead
    * Incident Coordinator tracks and manages activities and coordinates with other groups
* **Security Operations Center (SOC)** - Focused on monitoring networks and systems 
    * Often a group within a CSIRT
* Incident Plans
    * Outlines procedures for each step of incident response
    * Incident response procedures - Step by step instructions
    * System information - Network diagrams, system diagrams, assets etc
    * 
## Incident Response Tools
* Detection and management tools
* Documentation tools
* Investigative tools

(See previous notes in addition on the tools below)
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** - Monitors system/network activity, analyzes and sends alerts for potential incidents
* **Intrustion Prevention System (IPS)** - Like IDS but can do more in response
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** - Monitors activity on endpoints (connected devices)
    * Has capabilities of IDS/IPS plus behavioral analysis
    * Uses AI/ML to look for suspicious behavior
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** - Analyze log data and alert potential incidents 
    * Compiles info condense dashboard
    * SIEM tools process
        * Collect and aggregate data from logs
        * Normalize (clean up raw data)
        * Analyze according to predetermined rules
* **Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR)** - Collection of applications/tools that uses automation to respond to incidents
    * Automatically analyzes and responds
    * Can track collections of incidents as cases

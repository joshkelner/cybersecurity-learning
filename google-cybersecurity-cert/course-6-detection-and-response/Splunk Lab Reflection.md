## Splunk Lab Reflection - Qwiklabs

###  üîç What I Learned
* I learned the basics of how to navigate Splunk Cloud, perform queries, and understand their results
    * Then applied this knowledge to query data for a realistic scenario
* I learned how to manually upload data from a log file to Splunk in order to analyze it, though in many cases log data would be forwarded to a SIEM automatically
* I used my knowledge of SPL and experimented with different queries in order to narrow down my search and find the data I was looking for 


### üõ†Ô∏è SPL queries Practiced
* index = 
* host = 
* sourcetype = 
* Keyword search: fail* root
* AND, OR, !
* | 
* chart count by host


### üß† Reflections
* I was very excited for this lab because of how much I had already heard about Splunk, and even with this simple introduction I can see how useful it can be
* This lab felt more realistic than other ones since my goal throughout this search was to explore potential security issues with company's mail server by located failed SSH logins from the root account
    * I really enjoyed how this felt like a genuine scenario I might encounter working in security
* I feel more comfortable using Splunk for basic queries now, but I can tell that there is so much more to learn about the platform if I really want to take full advantage of it

## Wireshark Lab Reflection - Qwiklabs

###  üîç What I Learned
* Learned how to perform a basic network traffic analysis using Wireshark on a Windows VM
* Learned how to inspect a packet and understand some of the details they contain
    * How to read the IPv4, TCP, Ethernet, and Frame details
* Applied my knowledge of IP to identify different parts of the IPv4 protocols and their meanings
* Learned how to filter packets by IP, MAC, port, and protocol


### üõ†Ô∏è Filters/Commands Practiced
* ip.addr == 
* ip.src == 
* ip.dst == 
* eth.addr == 
* udp.port == 53 (for DNS traffic)
* tcp.port == 80 (for web traffic)
* tcp contains ""


### üß† Reflections
* This lab was very interesting and gave me some great hands-on experience with what network traffic analysis actually looks like
* I have a much better understanding of the information contained in packet headers including how I can use that information to filter packets and view trends in network traffic
* Before this lab I knew the general idea of what network traffic analyzers did, but not how they actually display packet data and how they filter it
* I feel a lot more comfortable using network traffic analyzers now and I want to figure out how to use them on network traffic in my own home next

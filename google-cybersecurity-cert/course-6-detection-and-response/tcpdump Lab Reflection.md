## tcpdump Lab Reflection - Qwiklabs

###  üîç What I Learned
* Learned how to identify what network interfaces I can use to capture network data (either using ifconfig or tcpdump)
* Learned the basics of how to capture live packets using tcpdump and various optional flags I can use to enhance my results
* Practiced both writing packet data to a pcap file and reading packet data from a pcap file
* Learned how to interpret and analyze the information that tcpdump outputs, specifically by generating, capturing, and analyzing HTTP traffic


### üõ†Ô∏è Commands Practiced
* sudo
* ifconfig
* tcpdump
    * -D
    * -i
    * -v
    * -c
    * -w
    * -r
    * -nn
    * -X
* curl
* &


### üß† Reflections
* This lab greatly enhanced my understanding of how powerful network traffic analyzers can be and I feel much more comfortable using them
* I've strengthened my ability to interpret packet data and actually draw conclusions from it
* While the CLI interface of tcpdump is a little less intuitive than Wireshark's GUI, I can see how useful its effeciency would be
* I want to try testing both tcpdump and Wireshark on network traffic in my own home to better familiarize myself with their uses and their different interfaces

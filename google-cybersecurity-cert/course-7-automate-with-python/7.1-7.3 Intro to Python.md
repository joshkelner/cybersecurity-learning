### *Notes for this section on basic Python are condensed and less detailed because I already have a lot of experience using it

## Intro to Python
* Python is a general-purpose language - used for a variety of programs and not specialized in one area
    * Commonly used for web development, data analysis, security
* Used in security to automate repetitive tasks
    * Parsing logs
    * Manage access control
    * Connect separate tasks together
* Advantages
    * Readable
    * Standard guidelines
    * Lots of support and libraries
* Script vs Program
    * **Script** - Smaller, one-off pieces of code for specific tasks
        * Typically interpreted, minimal overhead
        * Specific type of program
    * **Programs** - General term, typically larger and more complex
        * Typically more structured, larger proejcts
        * Scripts are a subset of programs
* Ways to use Python
    * Notebooks
    * IDEs
    * CLI
* Data types, variables conditionals 
* Loops (for, while) 
* Functions 
    * Built-in or user-defined
* Library - collection of modules (files) a user can access in a program 
    * **Python Standard Library** - a lot of standard modules
        * re - search for patterns
        * csv - for CSV files
        * glob, os - interacting with command line
        * time, datetime - for timestamps
        * statistics
        * a lot more
    * Can download external libraries (Beautiful Soup, NumPy, etc)
* Style guides - manual of writing/sylistic conventions
    * PEP 8
    * Following style guides improves efficiency, readability, and scalability
* Strings - ordered sequence of characters 
    * Casting - in python use functions like str() int()
    * len(), .upper() .lower() .index()
    * \+ for concatenation
    * Immutable
* Lists - store different items in a single variable
    * \+ for concatenation
    * Mutable - list[1] = "newValue"
    * .insert(position, element), .remove(element), .append(element)
* Regex - sequence of characters that forms a pattern
    * Useful for searching
    * \+ : one or more occurences of a character
        * a+ is any amount of a's
    * \* : zero, one or more occurences
    * {} : specific number of occruences ex. {2}
        * {1,3} 1,2, or 3 occurences {min,max}
    * /w : matches any alphanumeric character or _ (but not symbols)
        * \w+@\w+\.\w+
            * Matches email
            * Need \ before . because it has special meaning
    * . : matches all chars/symbols (\\. matches . )
    * \d : matches digits 0-9
    * \s : matches single space
    * 
    * re module
        * re.finall(pattern, string) - returns list of matches

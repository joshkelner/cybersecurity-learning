## Automating with Python
**Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps)** - Integrating security directly into how you build and deploy software
* Use Python to automate CI/CD pipeline security
    * **Security Testing**
        * **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
            * SAST tools test code for weaknesses before its built
            * Use Python to start tools, analysze results, and automatically stop processes
        * **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**
            * Test while code is running in test area
            * Use Python to start tools, and scripts to analyze results
        * **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**
            * Checks dependencies for weaknesses
            * Use Python to control SCA process, report problems, set rules based on results
    * **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**
        * Use Python to schedule scans, collect results, send alerts
    * **Compliance Checks**
        * Use scripts to check if code/infrastructure follows security guidelines
    * **Secrets Management Automation**
        * Scripts can review code and stop private credentials from being put in
    * **Policy Enforcement**
        * Check code against security policies and automatically stop deployments
* Many CI/CD tools have APIs that Python can use
* Python can automate setting up environments, run code quality tools, actual staging/deployment
### Files
* **with open("file.txt", "r") as file:**
* Use w for writing (replaces), a for appending
* **.read()** converts file into a string
* **.write("text")** for writing (both w and a mode)
* **.split("divider")** converts string into list by splitting on a character (default is whitespace)
* **"divider".join(list)** concatenates iterable into string
    * call it on divider char
### Debugging
* Syntax Errors
    * Invalid use of language
    * Error message specifies line #
* Logic Errors
    * Produce unintended results
    * May not produce error message
* Exception
    * Program doesn't know how to execute code

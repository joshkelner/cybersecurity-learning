## Security Risk Planning
* Based on analyzing three things: Assets, Threats, Vulnerabilities
* **Asset** 
    * Item that has value to an organization
    * Digital or physical
    * Some are higher and lower priority to defend, or easier/harder to defend
    * Need to efficiently allocate security resources
* **Threat** 
    * Event that can negatively impact assets
    * Can be accidental or intentional attacks
    * Help dictate where security resources should go
* **Vulnerabilities**
    * Weakness that threats could exploit
    * Flaws in assets
    * Need to be minimized
* Threats and vulnerabilities are factors in **risk**
    * One way to think about risk is Impact x Likelihood
* **Asset management** - Keeping track of assets and their different chracteristics
    * Need **Asset inventory** - catalog of assets that need protection
    * **Asset classification** - categorizing them based on their sensistivity
        * Public: can share with anyone
        * Internal-only: Only employees
        * Confidential: Only those working specifically with it
        * Restricted: Highly classified, only specific employees
* Data states
    * **In use** - Data currently being accessed
    * **In transit** - Data traveling/being sent
    * **At rest** - Data not being accessed or sent (in database or cloud)
* **Information Security (InfoSec)** - Keeping data in all states safe from unauthorized users
* Three categories of risk
    * **Damage**
    * **Disclosure**
    * **Loss of Information**

### Elements of Security Plans
* **Policies** - Rules that reduce risk
    * Gives everybody guidance in how to conduct themselves
* **Standards** - References for informing policy
    * Measurements of how a company is being secure
* **Procedures** - Instructions for performing specific security tasks
    * Step-by-step
    * ex How to change password
### Compliance
* Following regulations and internal standards
    * Not being in compliance risks financial, legal, trust issues
* **NIST CSF** - Guidelines and best practices for security
    * Voluntary (not legally enforced)
    * **Core** - Simplified version of duties of a security plan
        * Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
    * **Tiers** - Way to measure performance across 5 functions
        * 1-4 (passive to adaptive)
    * **Profiles**
        * Insight into current state of plan

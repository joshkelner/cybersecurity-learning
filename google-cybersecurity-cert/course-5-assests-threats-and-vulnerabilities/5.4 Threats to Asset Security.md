## Social Engineering
* Exploiting human error to gain access or information
* Stages
    * Prepare, gather info
    * Establish trust
    * Use persuasion tactics
    * Disconnect from the target
* Phishing leverages communication technologies like email
    * **Phishing kit** - Software tools for phishing with limited technical background, 3 parts
        * **Malicious attachments** - Files that can cause harm
        * **Fake data collection forms** - Look like surveys but ask for sensitive info
        * **Fraudulent web links** - Open malicious domains
## Malware
* Malicious software
* Spread through USB or online
* Common types:
    * **Virus** - code that interferes with operations and causes damage. Clones and spreads. Must be activated by user
    * **Worm** - Duplicates and spreads on its own (without user action)
    * **Trojan** - Disguised as harmless file
    * **Ransomware** - Encrypt organizations data and demand money. Have to make themselves known
    * **Spyware** - Gather and sell information without consent
* **Cryptojacking** - Installs software to mine crypto
    * Signs include slowdown, high CPU usage, draining battery
## Web Exploits
* Take advantage of coding flaws in application (high traffic site) to spread malware
* **Injection attack** - Inserting malicious code into application
    * Take advantage of user input to site
* **Cross-site scripting (XSS)** - Inserts malicious code into webpage (normally HTML or JS)
    * **Reflected** - Malicious script is sent to server and activated during server's response (user tries to go to site and it sends script back)
    * **Stored** - Malicious script is on server, loads when site is visited
    * **DOM-based** - Script exists in the webpage URL (hide malicious JS in HTML tage). Can be seen beforehand
* **Session hijacking** - Attacker takes over user session and impersonates user by stealing session cookie. Can impersonate them without password
* Many websites run SQL queries on backend
* **SQL Injection** - executes unexpected queries on DB
    * Occurs when user input is taken as is
    * Prepared statements execute SQL statements before passing on to DB to prevent injection
    * **In-band** - Most common, fully executed on the site
    * **Out-of-band** - Less common, use different communication channel (like connecting website to your own database)
    * **Inferential** - Can't see results directly, infer structure of system based on response
## Threat Modeling
* Identifying assets, their vulnerabilities, and how they're exposed to threats
* 6 Steps:
    * **Define scope** - Inventory of assets
    * **Identify threats** - Internal or external. Make attack tree mapping threats to assets
    * **Characterize environment** - Who interacts with it and how
    * **Analyze threats** - Assign risk scores
    * **Mitigate risk** - Come up with plan. Avoid, tranfser, reduce, or accept risk
    * **Evaluate findings** - Document

    **Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA)**
    * Common threat modeling process
        * Define business/security objectives
        * Define technical scope (components you're evaluating)
        * Decompose application (dataflow diagram)
        * Threat analysis
        * Vulnerability analysis
        * Attack modeling (simulate)
        * Analyze risk and impact
    * Other modeling framworks (STRIDE, Trike, VAST)

## Vulnerability Management
* Process of finding a patching vulnerabilities
* Four steps:
    * **Identify vulnerabilities**
    * **Consider potential exploits**
    * **Prepare defenses**
    * **Evaluate the defenses**
* **Exploit** - Way to take advantage of vulnerability
    * **Zero-day exploit** - One that was previously unknown
        * Have to figure out how to defend in real time
### CI/CD Pipelines
* Make software development more efficient
* **Continuous integration**
    * Frequently merge changings and automated building and testing (immediate feedback)
* **Continuous delivery**
    * Automatically move code to staging area for release after passing tests
* **Continuous deployment**
    * Sometimes require manual check to deploy or do it all automatically
* Benefits:
    * Reduce human error/vulnerabilities
    * Improved code quality and security if tests are rigorous
    * Faster time to market (including security patches)
    * Frequent small releases rather than one big release (less risky)
* Vulnerabilities:
    * Pipelines use many third-party libraries/dependencies
    * Unauthorized users can gain access to whole development process
    * Hardcoding sensitive data into pipeline
    * Need to secure pipeline infrastructure not just the code
### Defense in depth
* Layered defenses that each provide different forms of security
* Typically uses 5-layer design: 
* **Perieter layer** - User authentication filter (like password)
* **Network layer** - More about authorization. Network firewalls and others
* **Endpoint layer** - Endpoints are devices that access a network. This layer protects the devices (ex antivirus software) 
* **Application layer** - All interfaces used to access technology, security is programmed in
* **Data layer** - Critical data that must be protected
### Common Vulnerabilities
* Many libraries of common vulnerabilities
* **Exposures** - Mistake that can be exploited
* **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list** - openly accessible dictionary
    * Popular resource created by MITRE
    * Standard way of classifying CVEs
    * Reported CVEs get reviewed by CVE Numbering Authoriy (CNA) for four criteria
        * Independent of other issues
        * Recognized as risk by whoever reports
        * Submit with supporting evidence
        * Only affect one codebase
    * If it qualifies it gets CVE ID
    * OWASP Top 10
        * List of most targeted web vulnerabilities
    * **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** is a good way to learn about security risks and vulnerabilities

## Protecting Information
* Security controls
    * **Technical** - technologies for protecting assets
    * **Opetational** - day to day operations and awareness
    * **Managerial** - policies and procedures
* Principal of Least Privilege
    * Only have access to what you need
    * Different types of accounts: guest, user, service, priveleged
* Data Lifecycle: How data flows through an organization
    * **Collect**
    * **Store**
    * **Use**
    * **Archive**
    * **Destroy**
* **Data Governance** - processes for how organization manages data
    * Data owners (make decisions)
    * Data custodians (handle, transport, store)
    * Data stewards (person/group that implements data governance policies)
* Notable privacy regulations: GDPR (EU), PCI DSS (financial), HIPAA (medical)
## Encryption
* One of the most common security controls for protecting information
* Make it so data can't be read in transit (ciphertext)
* **Cipher** - algorithm that encrypts information
* **Cryptographic Key** - Mechanism for decrypting ciphertext
* Can try to decrypt using brute force attack
* **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**
    * Starts with exchange of encrypted info
        * **Assymetric** - use of public and private key pair
            * Public key users can add/send info
            * Only private key can read/decrypt
            * 3DES, AES
        * **Symmetric** - use of one shared sectret key
            * Faster but riskier
            * RSA, DSA
    * Uses system of digital certificates to establish trust
        * **Digital Certificate** - verifies identity of public key holder
        * Overseen by Certificate Authority (CA)
            * Uses data to verify company and encrypts is using own private key
            * Creates certificate with CA's signature and public key for site
* Generating keys
    * **OpenSSL**
        * Command-line tool for generating public and private keys
        * Can use variety of algorithms
    * Other tools available
* Algorithms should not rely on secrecy
    * You should be able to know details of algorithm and still not be able to crack it
    * Kerchoff's principle
## Hashing
* Algorithm that produces code that can't be decrypted
* One-way process
* Produces unique identifier (determine integrity of files)
* Use command line to generate hash for any file 
* Short hash values are vulnerable to **hash collisions** - multiple inputs produce same output
    * **Secure Hashing Algorithms (SHA)** - generate longer values and are collision-resistant
* Secure password storage
    * Store passwords as a hash so you can still compare user inputted passwords but they can't be stolen
* **Salting** - adding random string to data before hashing
    * Additional security
    * Same entries produce different values 
    * Protects against rainbow tables for passwords  
## Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting Frameworks (AAA)
* **Authentication** - verify who the user is
    * Three ways: 
        * Knowledge - they know something like a password
        * Ownership - they have something (on time password to phone)
        * Characteristic - something they are (biometric)
    * **Single sign-on (SSO)**
        * Streamlines authentication by not having them sign in everytime
        * Relies on trusted third-parties, encrypted access tokens
        * Significant vulnerabilities if used alone
        * Need **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
            *  Requires 2+ independent credentials
* **Authorization** - verify what user is allowed to do
    * Follow least privelege and separation of duties
    * **HTTP basic auth** - establish user's request to access server
        * Send identifier everytime user talks to web page
        * Transmits username and password openly over network
        * HTTPS doesn't expose info
    * **OAuth: open-standard authorization protocol** - Shares access between applications
        * ex Letting website access google profile to create account
        Uses API tokens (block of encrypted code)
        * Keep password safe in case of breach on platform
* **Accounting** - Monitoring access logs
    * User initiates a **session** when accessing system
        * Sequence of HTTP basic auth requests and responses with same user
    * **Access logs** are records of sessions
    * **Session ID** is created at start of session
        * Unique identifier for user and their device until session ends
    * Exchange of **session cookies** happen between server and user at start of session
        * Token websites use to validate session and determine what to show you
    * **Session hijacking** - attacker obtains user's session ID

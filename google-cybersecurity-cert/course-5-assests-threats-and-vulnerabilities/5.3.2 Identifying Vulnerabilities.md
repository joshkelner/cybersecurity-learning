## Vulnerability Assessment
* Internal review of security systems
* Four step process:
    * **Identification** - Scanning tools and manual testing
    * **Vulnerabilit Analysis** - Find source of problem
    * **Risk Assessment** - Assign score based on severity and likeliness of being exploited (prioritize)
    * **Remediation** - fix them
* Vulnerability scanners (identification)
    * Tools compare system against database of vulnerabilities
    * Different types
    * **External vs Internal**: simulate trying to break in or look at application from the inside
    * **Authenticated vs Unauthenticated**: Simulate user access or not
    * **Limited vs Comprehensive**: Either analyze particular devices or scan all
* Patch updates (remediation)
    * Manual
        * Have to find and install updates manually
        * Control over what you update
        * Might forget important updates
    * Automatic (reccomended by CISA)
        * Done by the system
        * Simple and stays up to date
        * No control if vendor releases poor patch
    * End of life (EOL) software stopd recieving patch updates, can be dangerous to use
### Penetration Testing
* Simulated attack
* Not just find vullnerabilities but also exploit them
* Strategies:
    * **Open-box** - Tester has priveleged access like internal developer
    * **Closed-box** - Tester has little/no inside access. 
    * **Partial knowledge** - Some access and knowledge but not full (like a customer service rep)
### Types of threat actors
* Competitors - might benefit from leaked info
* State actors - government intelligence
* Criminal syndicates - Organized groups making money
* Insider threats - Can be intentional or accidentla
* Shadow IT - Using technology that lacks IT protection (using personal email for work info) 
* **Hackers**
    * Unauthorized/malicious
    * Authorized/ethical
    * Semi-authorized (ex hacktivist)
* **Advanced Persisten Threats (APTs)**
    * Threat actor maintains unauthorized access
* Different types of attack vectors: 
    * Direct physical access
    * Removeable media (USB, hard drive)
    * Social media/email
    * Wireless networks
    * Cloud
    * Supply chains

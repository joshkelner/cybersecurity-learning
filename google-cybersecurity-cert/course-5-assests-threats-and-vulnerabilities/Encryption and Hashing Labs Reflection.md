## Encryption and Hashing Labs Reflection - Qwiklabs

###  üîç What I Learned
* Learned the basics of encryption and decryption through the Shell
* Decrypted a basic Caeser cipher using Bash commands and a more complicated cipher using OpenSSL
* Used hashing as means for verifying the integrity of two seemingly identical files in the Shell



### üß† Reflections
* This lab gave me some valuable insight into how encryption and hashing work and their actual applications
* It was especially interesting to see how two files could look completely identical when simply viewing their contents but then produce different hash values after applying a hash function to both
* This simple example illustrates some of the many uses of hashing in verifying data and maintaining its integrity

### üß† Reflections
* This lab was really effective at not just teaching me new commands but expanding my knowledge of how Linux works and is structured
* I now have a much better understanding of how permissions are actually organized and managed rather than just the concept of having them
* I understand the concept of the root user and using sudo for elevated priveleges which was new to me
* Overall I feel like I have a much better grasp of how powerful Linux can be and its level of organization

## Operating Systems
* Interface between user and computer hardware
* Makes computer run efficiently and easy to use
* Common ones: Windows, MacOS, Linux (open source & useful for security), ChromeOS, Android & iOS (mobile)
* **Legacy Operating Systems** - Outdated operating system that is still being used because it is hard to switch over, comes with security risks

User -> Application -> OS -> Hardware (and reverse)
* Booting the computer
    * When turned on either **Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)** or **Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)** microchip is activated
    * UEFI is newer 
    * Contains loading instructions
    * Last instruction activates **bootloader** which loads OS
* Allocating resources 
    * OS is responsible for allocating a computer's resources
    * Programs and processes compete for resources of **central processing unit (CPU)**
        * Each need memory, storage, input/output bandwidth
    * Can view this allocation in task manager
## Virtual Machines
* Virtual version of physical computer
    * Software simulates hardware
* Host computer divides physical resources between VMs
    * If host has 16GB of **Random Access Memory (RAM)** (short term memory) it can host 3 4GB VMs and have 4GB for itself
* VMs are isolated and more secure (can examine malware)
* Efficient for multiple security tasks (switch between VMs easily)
    * **Hypervisors** are software that help manage multiple VMs
    * **Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)** - open-source hypervisor built into Linux
## User Interface
* Program that lets user interact with OS
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
    * Uses icons on screen to manage tasks (ex phone apps)
    * More user/beginner friendly
    * One task at a time
* **Command-line Interface (CLI)**
    * Text-based, use commands to interact with OS
    * No icons, more like lines of code
    * More flexible and powerful than GUI
        * Control and customization
        * Can do more tasks at once
    * Linux CLI saves all commands in history file

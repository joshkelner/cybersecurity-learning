## Linux
* Commonly used in security world
* Open-source - anyone can access source code
* Developed based on UNIX with introduction of Linux kernel
* Different distributions have tools for different tasks
* Linux architecture
    * **User**
        * Person interacting with computer
        * Initiates tasks for OS to execute
        * Can have more than one user
    * **Applications**
        * Program that performs specific task
    * **Shell**
        * How you communicate with the system (CLI)
    * **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**
        * Organizes data
        * **Directory** (aka folder) - file that organizes other files. Contains other files or directories
    * **Kernel**
        * Manages processes and memory
        * Ensures efficient allocation
        * Communicates with hardware
    * **Hardware**
        * Physical components
        * **Internal hardware** - Components required to run (CPU, RAM, hard drive)
        * **Peripheral devices** - Hardware that's attached/controlled by system (monitor, mouse, keyboard etc)
## Distributions
* Different versions on Linux with different tools
    * Different pre-installed programs, interfaces etc
* Anyone can modify the kernel since it's open-source (create new distro)
* All distros are derived from others (parent distros)
### Kali Linux
* Derived from Debian
* Designed for pen testing, digital forensics
* Should use on VM
* Pen testing tools:
    * **Metasploit** - Look for/exploit vulnerabilities
    * **Burp Suite** - Test for vulnerabilities in web apps
    * **John the Ripper** - Guessing passwords
* **Digital forensics** - Using data to determine what happened after an attack
    * **tcpdump** - CLI pack analyzer
    * **Wireshark** - GUI for analyzaing network traffic
    * **Autopsy** - For analyzing hard drives and smart phones
### Other Distros
* **Ubuntu**
    * Open-source
    * User friendly
    * CLI and GUI
    * Wide uses including cloud computing
* **Parrot**
    * Open-source
    * Also used for security
    * CLI and user-friendly GUI
* **Red Hat**
    * Subscription based
    * Enterprise use
    * Dedicated support team
* **AlmaLinux**
    * Community driven
    * Replacement for CentOS
### Package Managers
* **Package** - piece of software that can be combined with other packages to form application
* **Package manager** - helps install/manage packages
    * Resolve dependency issues and other management
* Certain package managers work with certain distros (and ones derived from them)
    * dpkg for Debian-derived
* **Package management tools** - Easily perform basic tasks (like installing) through the shell
    * APT for Debian-derived
## The Shell
* Type of CLI
* Bash is a common type of shell (and scripting language)
    * Default in most distros
    * User-friendly
    * Most popular in cybersecurity
* Standard input - info OS recieves through shell
* Standard output - info OS outputs through shell
* Standard error - contains error messages returned by OS

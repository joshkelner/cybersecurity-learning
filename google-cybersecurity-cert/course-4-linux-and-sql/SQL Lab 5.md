## SQL Lab 5 Reflection - Qwiklabs

###  üîç What I Learned
* Practiced using a few different joins
* Refreshed my knowledge of join syntax and my ability to recognize what type of join is appropriate for different situations

### üõ†Ô∏è Commands Practiced
```sql
SELECT
FROM
INNER JOIN
LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
FULL OUTER JOIN
ON
%
_
```
### üß† Reflections
* Joins are again something I've already had a fair amount of experience with, but they can be very powerful when using SQL and are always good to practice
* It was helpful to get a chance to look at different situations and examples and identify which join to use

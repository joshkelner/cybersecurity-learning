###  🧠 Reflections
* This lab was a mix of refreshers of my prior knowledge from using the shell on MacOS as well as new commands to expand my Linux vocabulary
* I feel much more comfortable navigating through the FHS in Linux, and I feel more confident in my ability to search and manipulate files through the command line rather than the GUI

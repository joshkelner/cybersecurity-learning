## Databases and SQL
(I already have a decent amount of SQL experience from college curriculum so notes may not be as detailed)
* Store large amounts of data, organize and accesss quickly
* Relational database - tables are related to each other
    * Primary key - unique identifier
    * Foreign key - column that is primary key in another table
* Filtering with SQL is more powerful and structured than filtering with Linux
    * Easier to adjust data, joins are very powerful
    * Still useful to filter with Linux for some cases (like text files)
## SQL Queries
* SELECT 
* FROM
* ORDER BY (DESC)
* WHERE
* LIKE
    * Wildcards: % substitutes for string, _ substitutes for one character
* Data and time data
    * 6pm -> 18:00
    * March 1st 2021 -> 2021-03-01
    * Can filter like numerical (but write with '')
* BETWEEN (inclusive)
* AND
* OR
* NOT
* JOIN
    * Primary key of one table to foreign key of another
    * INNER JOIN - returns matching rows on 2+ tables for a specific column
    * ON
* Outer joins
    * LEFT JOIN - all rows of first table and rows of second that match
    * RIGHT JOIN - all rows of second table and rows of first that match
    * FULL OUTER JOIN - all rows of both
* Aggregate functions
    * COUNT
    * AVG
    * SUM

## AI in Cybersecurity
* Double-edged sword
    * Powerful tool to use for cybersecurity
    * Also comes with vulnerabilities if used improperly, and can be used by threat actors to launch sophisticated attacks
* Uses for generative AI
    * Create content
    * Analyze information
    * Research
    * Support routine tasks
* Prompt framework
    * **Task** - What do you want it to do
        * **Persona**: What expertise should it draw from? What audience is it targeting? "You are a ...."
        * **Format**: How should output appear? (list, sentences, etc)
    * **Context** - Details for it to understand what you want
    * **References** - Examples for it to know what you're looking for
    * **Evaluate** - Was the output what you wanted?
    * **Iterate** - Try again by adding more info or editing prompt/providing feedback
* AI is most useful as a complement to human skill
### Example Uses For AI
* Break down complex security frameworks
    * Can extract key concepts from lengthy security frameworks
    * Give reccomendations for potential areas of improvement in line with the framework and how to implement them
* Identifying bugs in code
* Update and improve existing code
    * Add comments to make it more understandable
* Understand system vulnerabilities
    * Break them down and explain
    * Identify their potential impact
    * Ways to mitigate
* Prioritize alerts
    * Categorize based on severity
    * Include explanations for its analysis

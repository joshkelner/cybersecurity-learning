## What is a Network?
* Group of connected devices
    * Different devices are connected at home vs an office
* Communicate through network cables or wireless
    * Communicate with networks in other locations
* Use addresses to locate each other (IP and MAC)
* Two types of networks:
    * **Local Area Network (LAN)** 
        * Small area like a building
        * LAN connects to internet
    * **Wide Area Network (WAN)**
        * Spans city or country
        * Internet is big WAN

**Network Traffic Analysis** - Looking at various layers of the network and the traffic going across it
* How can we secure the traffic? Are there vulnerabilities?
### Common Network Devices
* **Hub** - Broadcasts information to all devices on network
* **Switch** - Connects specific devices. Only passes data to intended one (more secure)
* **Router** - Connects multiple networks together
* **Modem** - Connects router to the internet (gives LAN internet access)
* **Firewall** - Security device that monitors and restricts traffic. Between internal network and outside
* **Wireless Access Point** - Creates wireless network devices can connect to

**Virtualization Tools** - Software that performs network operations. Offered by cloud service providers and complete tasks that these other devices would do

**Cloud Networks** - Using remote network services rather than local/physical
* Resources/data stored in remote data center
* Accessed over internet (from anywhere!)
* Reliable, cost-effective, scalable

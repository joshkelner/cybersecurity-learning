## Security Hardening
**Strengthening a system to reduce vulnerabilities and attack surface**
Attack surface = potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited
* Consists of regular maintenence on systems, networks, and hardware
    * Can be physical too (locks, security cameras, etc)
* Examples of security hardening
    * Software updates/patches
    * Device application configuration changes
    * Removing/disabling unused applications, ports
    * Reducing access permissions
    * Regular **penetration testing** (simulated attack)
## OS Hardening
* OS is intermediary between software/user and computer hardware
* Some hardening tasks occur regularly
    * Patch update
        * Released by OS vendors to address security concerns
        * Threat actors then know where vulnerabilities in old systems were
        * Important for companys to upgrade immediately
        * Newly updated OS should be added to **base configuration** (set of specifications for future builds and updates)
    * Hardware and software disposal
* Some are general policies
    * Password policy
* **Brute Force Attacks** - Trial and error process to discover information (usually passwords)
    * Simple brute force attacks - Just guessing
    * Dictionary attacks - Using list of common passwords or ones found in breaches
### Assessing Vulnerabilities
* **Virtual Machines (VM)** - software versions of physical computers
    * Run code/test malware in isolated enviroment
    * Prevent damage and can be deleted
    * Some risk of escaping
* **Sanbox Enviroments** - allow for executing programs separate from network
    * For testing patches or malware
    * Can be physical computers not connected to anything
    * Cloud-based VMs are easier
* However malware can be designed so that it knows if its in a VM/sandbox and behaves normally
## Network Hardening
* **Network log analysis** - Exmamining logs for events of interest. Often using SIEM tools
* **Port filtering** - Using a firewall to block certain port numbers. Only allow ones that are needed
* **Network segmentation** - Create subnets for different departments. Limits access and issues don't spread
* **Encrypt network communication**
* **Firewalls** - Allow or block traffic (see earlier notes)
* **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** - Application that monitors network traffic and sends alerts for possible intrusions
    * Analyzes packets for characteristics of known attacks or obvious anomolies (but can't go much further)
* **Intrustion Prevention System (IPS)** - Like IDS but takes action to stop intruders
    * Gives alerts but also blocks senders or drops suspicious packets
## Cloud Hardening
* Use server baseline image for all server instances in cloud to ensure there are no unwanted changes
* Cloud security concerns
    * **Identity Access Management (IAM)** - Authorizing who can use what cloud resources
    * **Configuration** - Cloud services must be configured very precisely
    * **Attack surface** - CSPs use many different services and applications, each on is an entry point
    * **Zero-day attacks** - Previously unknown exploits
    * **Visibility and Tracking** - Accessing data packets, can't view as directly as on-site network but still have access
    * **Shared responsibility model** - Both users and CSPs take responsibility for security. CSP secures the cloud but users must ensure assets are configured properly
    * **Hypervisors** - Abstract hosts hardware from operating software environment
    * **Cryptography** - Encryption is a huge part of keeping data secure and encryption keys must be managed properly
        * **Cryptographic erasure** - Deleting data by destroying its encryption key rather than going through and deleting all of it

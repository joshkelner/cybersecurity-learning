## Network Attacks
* **Network Interception Attakcs** - Intercept network traffic and access data (packet sniffing) or interfere with transmission/alter data
    * Passive packet sniffing just observes data being sent
    * Active packet sniffing manipulates data being sent
* **Backdoor Attacks** - Backdoors are weaknesses intentionally left by programmers that bypass normal access control (for troubleshooting or admin). Can also be installed by attackers after compromising system to have continued access

### Denial of Service attack (DoS)
* Floods network or server with traffic
* Overload a business's network so it crashes or can't respond to real requests
* **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** - DoS attack that uses multiple devices in different locations to flood network
* **SYN (synchronize) flood attack**
    * Simulates TCP connection
    * First step is device sends SYN packet request
    * Normally would get SYN/ACK packet back and open port
    * Attackers flood network with SYN requests to overload
* **ICMP flood attack** 
    * Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is protocol for data transmission error messages
    * Works like a request for a status update
    * Attacker repeatedly sends ICMP packets to network server, forcing it to respond
    * Eventually use up all bandwidth
* **Ping of Death attack**
    * Attacker sends oversized ICMP (bigger than 64 KB)
    * Overload with one request

## Network Protocol Analyzers
* AKA packet sniffers or packet analyzers
* Capture and analyze data traffic in network
* **tcpdump** - Common packet sniffer tool
    * Lightweight, command line accessed
    * Prints info about packets in readable format
    * Key info
        * Timestamp
        * Source IP
        * Source port
        * Destination IP
        * Destination port
## IP Spoofing
* Attacker changes source IP of packet to impersonate authorized IP
* **On-path attack** - Attacker is in the middle of authorized connection and sniffs packet data to learn IP and MAC addresses, then can impersonate either side
* **Replay attack** - Attacker intercepts data and repeats it at another time to cause connection issues or impersonate authorized user
* **Smurf attack** - Combo of DDos and IP spoofing. Sniff authorized user's IP and flood it
* Should configure firewalls to block transmissions from same IP address as private network cause they should already be on the LAN, might be an impersonation

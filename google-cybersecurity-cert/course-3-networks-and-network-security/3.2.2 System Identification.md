## Firewalls
* Network security device, monitors traffic
* Allows or blocks traffic, may use port-filtering to only allow communication on certain ports
* **Hardware Firewall** - Most basic, inspects each packet before entering network
* **Software Firewall** - Same functions but not physical device, software program. Inspects all data recieved by computer/server.
    * Cheaper than hardware but adds processing burden to devices
* **Cloud-based Firewall (FaaS)** - Software firewalls hosted by CSP. Performs operations before traffic reaches organizaion's network
* Stateful vs Stateless
    * **Stateful** - Firewall that keeps track of information going through it. Analyzes traffic and filters out behavior that seems suspicious
    * **Stateless** - Doesn't keep track of packet data and just operates on pre-determined rules (less secure)
    * **Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)** - Performs stateful insprection and in-depth security like deep packet inspection and intrusion protection. Most secure
        * Some connect to cloud-based threat intelligence services so they can quickly update how they protect
## Virtual Private Network (VPN)
* Changes public IP address and hides virtual location
* Helps keep data private when using public network (like internet)
* Encrypts data trnasmitted over internet
* **Encapsulation**
    * Wraps sensitive data in other data packets
    * Encrypted data is inside packet that a router can read
    * Personal data (IP/MAC addresses) aren't readable in transit
* **Remote Access VPN** - Individual users connect to VPN server through internet
* **Site-to-Site VPN** - Enterprises use to expand network to other locations (multiple offices)
* **WireGuard/IPSec**
    * Two different VPN protocols used to encrypt traffic. VPN providers offer different VPN protocols
## Security Zones
* Network segmentation divides networks into segments with different security/access rules
* Security zones are segment that protects internal network from internet
* Networks can be divided into subnets to maintain privacy and isolate in case of threat
* **Uncontrolled Zone** - Any network outside organizations control (internet)
* **Controlled Zone** - Subnet that protects internal network from uncontrolled zone
    * **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)** - Outer layer. Isolate public-facing services that access internet like web servers and DNS servers that internet users would need to access
    * **Internal Network** - Private servers and data that organization wants to protect
    * **Restricted Zone** - Confidential, only accessible to certain employees
* Want firewalls in between Uncontrolled Zone, DMZ, Internal Network, Restricted Zone
## Subnetting
* Dividing network into smaller groups, improving efficiency within subnets
* Used to create security zones
* **Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)**
    * Method of assigning subnet masks to IP addresses to create subnet
## Proxy Servers
* Server that fulfills request by forwarding it to other server
* Between internet and network
* Uses different public IP and determines if connections are safe (hides networks IP)
* Can block unsafe websites that an organization's users shouldn't access
* Uses temporary memory to store data that is commonly requested by external servers (doesn't need to access internal ones constantly)
* **Forward Proxy Server** - Regulates/restricts access to internet. Hides user's IP and approves outgoing requests
* **Reverse Proxy Server** - Regulates/restricts internet access to internal server
* **Email Proxy Server** - Filters spam email

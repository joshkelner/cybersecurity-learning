## Key Terms
* **Network Communication** - Data is transferred from one point to another
* **Data Packets** - Pieces of data passed between devices. Contains info on origin, destination, and its message. Like mail
    * Header - Contains IP and MAC address of destination, protocol number (tells device what to do with it)
    * Body - Contains message
    * Footer - Signals that packet is done
* **Bandwidth** - Amount of a data a device recieves/second
* **Speed** - Rate at which packets are downloaded
* **Packet Sniffing** - Inspecting data packets across a network

## TCP/IP Model
**Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol** - Framework for visualizing how data is organized and transmitted across networks
* TCP
    * Allows two devices to connect and stream data
    * Instructions for organizing data
* IP
    * Standards for routing and addressing packets
    * IP address is string of chars that identify location of device on internet
    * IPv4
        * Four 1,2, or 3 digit #s separated by decimal
        * Used to be all of internet but got used up
    * IPv6
        * Created as internet grew
        * 32 characters (hex)
    * Public/private
        * Network has one public facing IP for all devices on it. Assigned by internet service provider to geographic location
        * Private IP is only seen by devices on a network to communicate with each other
        * **Network Address Translation (NAT)** - Translating between private and public IPs, operates on router or firewell 
* MAC address is another address assigned to each physical device on network. Switch uses it to know where to send data
        
* Port
    * Software-based location that organizes sending and recieving packets
    * Know how to process data based on port number
    * Common ports: 25 for email, 443 for secure internet communication, 20 for large file transfers
* Four Layers
    * **Network Access Layer** - Creation of data packets and transmission. Includes hardware devices and switches that direct data
    * **Internet Layer** - IP addresses are given to data packets for destination. Deals with connection between networks or LAN to internet
    * **Transport Layer** - Protocols to control traffic flow
    * **Application Layer** - Protocals determine how data interacts with reciever
## OSI Model
* Standardized concept describing 7 layers of network communication
    * **Physical** - Physical hardware involved
    * **Data link** - Organizes sending and recieving within network (switches)
    * **Network** - Recieves packets from data link layers and sends them to destination
    * **Transport** - Handles flow of transfer, segmentation (breaking data into smaller pieces to send and then reassembling)
    * **Session** - Responsible for maintaining connection between two devices and terminating when done
    * **Presentation** - Encryption and formats data to be understood by application
    * **Application** - Directly involves user, connects user to internet (ex browser uses HTTP or HTTPS to get information from internet server)

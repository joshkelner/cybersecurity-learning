## Network Protocols
- Rules used by devices on a network to outline delivery and structure of data
* Three categories
    * **Communication protocols** - Exchange of information over network (TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS)
    * **Management protocols** - Monitor/manage activity on network (SNMP, ICMP)
    * **Security protocols** - Ensure data is sent securely, use encrpytion to protect data in transit (HTTPS, SFTP)

Common protocols:
* **TCP - Transmission control protocol**
    * Allows two devices to connect and transmit data
    * Verifies both devices (TCP handshake)
* **ARP - Address Resoution Protocol**
    * Used to get MAC address of next router/device on the path
* **HTTPS - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure** 
    * Secure communication between client and website server. Securely request webpage and recieve one
    * Encrypts data using Secure Socket Layer and Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)
* **DNS - Domain Name System**
    * Translates internet domain names into IP addresses
    * Send domain name to DNS server and get back IP
* **SSH - Secure Shell**
    * Create secure connection with remote system (port 22)

## IEEE 802.11 (Wi-fi)
* Standards defining communication for wireless LANs
* Wi-fi Protected Access (WPA)
    * Wireless security protocol for devices connecting to internet 
    * Newer versions like WPA2, WPA3
* Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
    * Oldest wireless security protocol
    * Out of date, high risk
